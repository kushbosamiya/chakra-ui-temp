The good bacteria present in probiotics prevent the gas build-up and bloating that often causes acid reflux. It also allows nutrients and foods to be digested and absorbed correctly, which ultimately eliminates and reduces the possibility of occurrence of acidity.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong> Banana</strong>: Eating ripe bananas may help reduce gas and bloating as they are packed with potassium and soluble fibre. They help the body flush out excess sodium and reduce inflammation as too much salt can result in bloating and gas. Soluble fibre also helps to relieve constipation, which can be another cause of bloating.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Asafoetida (Hing)</strong>: Hing when added to delicacies adds a certain flavour and the medicinal properties present in it make it one of the best anti-bloating foods. Adding a dash of hing while cooking certain foods like chickpeas and potato prevents bloating and gastric issues. Another useful way to reduce bloating quickly is by drinking a mix of hing powder and black salt in a glassful of lukewarm water. You can also take a pinch of hing and mix it with a few drops of warm mustard oil and massage it on the navel to get relief from bloating and gas.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Fennel seeds (Saunf)</strong>: Fennel seeds are a digestive tract saviour and possess antispasmodic properties. The seeds have a compound that relaxes gastrointestinal spasms, which allows gas to pass and relieve bloating. You can chew few fennel seeds after every meal or sip on a fennel tea after meals to ease the digestion process.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Ginger</strong>: Ginger contains the digestive enzyme zingibain, which helps your digestive system break down protein. The compound potentially helps food to get digested easily, reducing bloating, gas or constipation. If you already feel bloated, you probably don't want to eat. So, you can simply eat ginger slices soaked in lemon juice or you can make ginger tea by adding a few slices of ginger to water and boil it for 5-10 minutes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Cucumber </strong>: is high in potassium, which helps negate the ill-effects of sodium that is known to cause bloating. It helps you eliminate extra sodium through urine. Cucumbers are rich in antioxidant quercetin, caffeic acid (the skin), vitamin C and silica that are known to reduce swelling. Just as how putting them around your eyes prevent puffiness, eating cucumber on a daily basis can help you de-bloat as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If food from home didn't work in reducing bloating, one should opt for ayurvedic medicine for bloating and gas by consulting with a doctor. In addition to incorporating anti-bloating foods into your diet, several other things when kept in mind can help prevent bloating. For example, be sure to eat slowly and chew your food thoroughly. This can help reduce how much air you swallow to prevent gas buildup. Refrain from eating too much salt. An excess of sodium causes the body to retain water.

Everyone should note that these ultimate research tools (various stages of clinical trials) as the basis of conventional drug discovery are pre-DNA discovery period protocols. Even today research methodology of drug discovery does not consider the genetic uniqueness of each human being to whom it is prescribed. This is a very serious defect that is not given cognizance in the pharmaceutical industry. Keeping an outdated protocol which does not take into account the basic genetic system of human beings, is the biggest fraud and greatest crime against humanity. The attempt to universally inject COVID -19 vaccines based on mRNA needs to be understood in this context. It is not only an attempt to deny the basic freedom and personal choice of individuals but can damage the genetic code of human beings irreparably.

This makes the methodology of homeopathic drug discovery fool proof and pristine. We also note that the drugs discovered by Dr Hahnemann (99 drugs) to the drugs recently included in the homeopathic pharmacopoeia,  are all in daily use in homeopathy. Not even a single drug is banned or withdrawn anywhere due to adverse side effects. Faithful believers of conventional medicine claim that homeopathic drugs do not produce side effects as they are just water or placebo. But as a researcher who did one decade of studies with homeopathic ultra-high dilutions with advanced electron microscopy (HRTEM &amp; EDS, FESEM &amp; EDS) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), I am confident that these high dilution medicines are the rich source of nanoparticles of the original drug substance (See ref. book Nanodynamics and other published research papers in peer reviewed journals). I am also sure that millions of patients cured of their illnesses with this personalised nanomedicine (Homeopathy) are the living examples of a worthy science to heal human diseases.</p>\n<p>The proponents of one medical system for the world should realise that the so called modern medicine they are trying to implement in human society is an outdated science utilised to the maximum as a business enterprise, has little or no scope for the future. It is an empire ready to crumble.</p>\n<p>Human society needs different thoughts and approaches for any problems which are complex. Keeping every system of medicine active and growing, one can replace or complement another when need arises. If someone has dominance and refutes other thoughts and approaches, they will try to eliminate otherness. At this juncture, it is good to be aware of something that happened in China around 1955. As conventional modern medicine was gaining dominance in China, the leaders of the Chinese Medical Association met the the Chairman Mao and told him that the traditional Chinese healing practices are unscientific and outdated, needs to be abandoned as it takes some resources meant for health care (same argument we have heard recently from UK regarding the NHS budget on homeopathic hospitals, sadly the political leadership caved into this illogical argument, yet the British Royals have have the conviction beyond the ‘experts’ common sense). It seems that Mao listened to them carefully for an hour and replied to them that the people of China had lived well and healed well with traditional medicine for 10,000 years and if you don’t understand the science behind it, you just leave it and practice whatever you have learned. He just decided that conventional modern medicine was not a replacement for Traditional Chinese medicine, but an additional one. With this Mao proved his grit and created a balance, which preserved the traditional Chinese medicine in equal footing with conventional modern medicine. China and the world at large immensely benefited from this one decision of Mao. Every head of state and health ministers around the world need similar conviction and decisiveness to save humanity from the current COVID – 19 pandemic or the more dangerous pandemic which ‘Philanthropist’ Bill Gates recently predicted, hence the world is waiting for.</p>\n<p>In the current state of affairs, Germany can lead the world in this positive direction as homeopathy was born and flourished in Germany and still remains strong in the thoughts of people. It is a critical responsibility of the German political leadership to reinstate homeopathy as the primary health care solution for the population. As the questions about the scientific basis of homeopathy is being established in multiple ways, integrating homeopathy into the health care system in Germany, or any other nation is not a difficult task. It seems Germany has good human resources in homeopathy. Such a step can bring universal change in health care in a very short time. If the political leadership decides, it is only a matter of time to solve the complete scientific puzzles remaining with homeopathic drug action.</p>\n<p>The political leaderships around the world have a critical responsibility to safeguard the human race rather than facilitate the profit making of the pharma and medical industry. If they fail in doing so, they are failing the human race, which they are committed to protect. In this time of crisis a sane political leadership is more worthy of trust than the agenda based bureaucratic officials and leaders of the health industry. Let us hope for Mao’s wisdom in every leader in the world, as far as medicine is concerned. </p>\n",

It is an empire ready to crumble.\n\nHuman society needs different thoughts and approaches for any problems which are complex. Keeping every system of medicine active and growing, one can replace or complement another when need arises. If someone has dominance and refutes other thoughts and approaches, they will try to eliminate otherness. At this juncture, it is good to be aware of something that happened in China around 1955. As conventional modern medicine was gaining dominance in China, the leaders of the Chinese Medical Association met the the Chairman Mao and told him that the traditional Chinese healing practices are unscientific and outdated, needs to be abandoned as it takes some resources meant for health care (same argument we have heard recently from UK regarding the NHS budget on homeopathic hospitals, sadly the political leadership caved into this illogical argument, yet the British Royals have have the conviction beyond the ‘experts’ common sense). It seems that Mao listened to them carefully for an hour and replied to them that the people of China had lived well and healed well with traditional medicine for 10,000 years and if you don’t understand the science behind it, you just leave it and practice whatever you have learned. He just decided that conventional modern medicine was not a replacement for Traditional Chinese medicine, but an additional one. With this Mao proved his grit and created a balance, which preserved the traditional Chinese medicine in equal footing with conventional modern medicine. China and the world at large immensely benefited from this one decision of Mao. Every head of state and health ministers around the world need similar conviction and decisiveness to save humanity from the current COVID – 19 pandemic or the more dangerous pandemic which ‘Philanthropist’ Bill Gates recently predicted, hence the world is waiting for.\n\nIn the current state of affairs, Germany can lead the world in this positive direction as homeopathy was born and flourished in Germany and still remains strong in the thoughts of people. It is a critical responsibility of the German political leadership to reinstate homeopathy as the primary health care solution for the population. As the questions about the scientific basis of homeopathy is being established in multiple ways, integrating homeopathy into the health care system in Germany, or any other nation is not a difficult task. It seems Germany has good human resources in homeopathy. Such a step can bring universal change in health care in a very short time. If the political leadership decides, it is only a matter of time to solve the complete scientific puzzles remaining with homeopathic drug action.\n\nThe political leaderships around the world have a critical responsibility to safeguard the human race rather than facilitate the profit making of the pharma and medical industry. If they fail in doing so, they are failing the human race, which they are committed to protect. In this time of crisis a sane political leadership is more worthy of trust than the agenda based bureaucratic officials and leaders of the health industry. Let us hope for Mao’s wisdom in every leader in the world, as far as medicine is concerned. ",

        "content": "<h2 id=\"heading-anxiety-stress-and-depression-can-be-experienced-by-our-teenagers\">Anxiety, Stress and Depression can be Experienced by Our Teenagers</h2>\n<p>It's true to say that many of us experience life as busy and sometimes stressful. Teenagers are no exception. They have their own stressors whether from family, or school. To add to their load, they also have significant peer group stressors and this can sometimes be experienced as overwhelming. How I treat Teenager Stress, Anxiety and Depression is detailed in this Blog.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-problems-manifest-differently-in-teenage-girls-and-boys\">Problems Manifest Differently in Teenage Girls and Boys</h2>\n<p>In my counselling clinic I see children as young as 9 or 10 developing emotional or psychological difficulties that I used to see more often in teenagers. With these children it's very important that they gain some insight into their struggle. So I work with them to give them tools and strategies to assist them as they enter their teenage years. Social pressures amongst girls can escalate as hormones kick in during puberty, so the children who already have a toolkit of strategies to draw on can often cope very well.</p>\n<p>With boys I tend to see those who are well into puberty and are not coping at all well with those disruptive hormones; and who become sullen and withdrawn as well as sometimes angry. Often this is mostly contained at home which means the parents take the brunt of it all; but sometimes it spills over into school life and you can find your son getting into trouble and under performing in class</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-pressure-can-translate-into-anxiety\">Pressure Can Translate Into Anxiety</h2>\n<p>When teenagers find there is too much pressure they can sometimes become either depressed or anxious. I treated a teenage boy a few years back who was suffering from anxiety and finding simple things like getting public transport to school difficult, or attending assembly due to the crowd. I treated this client with a combination of Counselling and Homeopathy and after a few sessions he was back on track. He went on to have a happy,  successful school life and achieve his goals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-counselling-is-a-tune-up-for-our-emotional-selves\">Counselling is a Tune-Up For our Emotional Selves</h2>\n<p>Counselling no longer has the stigma it did. Many of us need  it, and I like to think of it as a tune up for our emotional selves. After all we take care of our physical body but tend to leave out mind and emotions to just sort themselves out. During puberty we know the brain gets almost completely re-wired. This is why we as parents, often feel like we no longer know our distant teenager. Well I can tell you a secret...they often feel they no longer know themselves!</p>\n<p>Teenagers are sometimes resistant to visiting a counsellor. When you talk to them about it, it helps to find out their reasons why and then address them one by one. Sometimes teenagers find it embarrassing to talk to another adult about their difficulties. Sometimes they do not understand the process of counselling and think they will have to divulge their inner most secrets. I would like to dispel that myth right away and describe how counselling can help your teenager when they are in need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-teenagers-respond-well-when-they-are-really-listened-to\">Teenagers Respond Well When They are Really Listened to.</h2>\n<p>I work with teenagers by normalizing their problems. This does not mean I dismiss them, far from it. I hear and acknowledge their difficulties, within the context of them not being alone in experiencing their issue. We discuss the whole issue from many angles and my aim is to help your teenager develop their own internal guidance system of how to act and react in certain situations. Importantly, I also expand their awareness around why they think, feel, and experience things the way they do; as well as bring their awareness to the impact of their actions on others. If they need to be more assertive and powerful we will work on that (and vice versa,) but never at the expense of helping to develop and whole, balanced individual who can meet the challenges of their teenage years with empowered self-understanding.</p>\n",

Social pressures amongst girls can escalate as hormones kick in during puberty, so the children who already have a toolkit of strategies to draw on can often cope very well.\n\nWith boys I tend to see those who are well into puberty and are not coping at all well with those disruptive hormones; and who become sullen and withdrawn as well as sometimes angry. Often this is mostly contained at home which means the parents take the brunt of it all; but sometimes it spills over into school life and you can find your son getting into trouble and under performing in class\n\n## Pressure Can Translate Into Anxiety\nWhen teenagers find there is too much pressure they can sometimes become either depressed or anxious. I treated a teenage boy a few years back who was suffering from anxiety and finding simple things like getting public transport to school difficult, or attending assembly due to the crowd. I treated this client with a combination of Counselling and Homeopathy and after a few sessions he was back on track. He went on to have a happy,  successful school life and achieve his goals.\n\n## Counselling is a Tune-Up For our Emotional Selves\nCounselling no longer has the stigma it did. Many of us need  it, and I like to think of it as a tune up for our emotional selves. After all we take care of our physical body but tend to leave out mind and emotions to just sort themselves out. During puberty we know the brain gets almost completely re-wired. This is why we as parents, often feel like we no longer know our distant teenager. Well I can tell you a secret...they often feel they no longer know themselves!\n\nTeenagers are sometimes resistant to visiting a counsellor. When you talk to them about it, it helps to find out their reasons why and then address them one by one. Sometimes teenagers find it embarrassing to talk to another adult about their difficulties. Sometimes they do not understand the process of counselling and think they will have to divulge their inner most secrets. I would like to dispel that myth right away and describe how counselling can help your teenager when they are in need.\n\n## Teenagers Respond Well When They are Really Listened to.\nI work with teenagers by normalizing their problems. This does not mean I dismiss them, far from it. I hear and acknowledge their difficulties, within the context of them not being alone in experiencing their issue. We discuss the whole issue from many angles and my aim is to help your teenager develop their own internal guidance system of how to act and react in certain situations. Importantly, I also expand their awareness around why they think, feel, and experience things the way they do; as well as bring their awareness to the impact of their actions on others. If they need to be more assertive and powerful we will work on that (and vice versa,) but never at the expense of helping to develop and whole, balanced individual who can meet the challenges of their teenage years with empowered self-understanding.\n",

        "content": "<h1 id=\"heading-allopathy-and-ayurveda\">Allopathy and Ayurveda</h1>\n<p>As I have been exploring the relationship between Ayurveda and allopathy, it is amazing to see the amount of opinions that are floating around about the issue.</p>\n<p>As one common and practical theme that I see emerging is the usefulness of adding modern understanding of human body and illnesses that allopathy has to Ayurveda to develop it further, I need to make a deeper point that really needs cognition by humanity at large.</p>\n<p>To start with, the core difference between most things Indian and western is the antiquity.</p>\n<p>Allopathy and Ayurveda are incomparable in terms of the duration for which they have served humanity.</p>\n<p>Allopathy as we know it now, is a product of technological advancements in our ability to “see” the inner workings of the body and hence most of its curative practices are barely 200 years old. Ayurveda, on the other hand, has been around for almost 1000/2000 years, if not more.</p>\n<p>If we really want to understand what it means, there is one very simple question we have to ask for allopathy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-will-allopathy-as-we-know-it-works-for-the-next-2000-years\">Will allopathy as we know it works for the next 2000 years?</h2>\n<p>An honest doctor who is watching antibiotic resistance rising or lifestyle problems emerging from those who receive quick cures from modern medicines would have to accept that it is extremely unlikely for most current allopathy medicines to work for even next fifty years.</p>\n<p>And if we speak to an evolutionary biologist, it gets worse as we get an Armageddon of pathogens becoming immune meeting humanity weakened by escaping natural selection due to allopathy. </p>\n<p>So, it is clear that allopathy, at this point is a bit like a quick fix of curing a human body but a scary harbinger of a massive crisis for humanity at large.</p>\n<p>If we look at Ayurveda, it may not be able to cure a plague or malaria that allopathy can, but it surely has its own slow way of bringing an imbalanced body back to balance and hence it is not helping pathogens to evolve and mitigating lifestyle diseases by offering a way of life through its slow and holistic cure that has more than just medicine popping as a cure.</p>\n<p>If we really start looking at “curing” as a bigger problem in the context of humanity, it is clear that allopathy is great in curing an individual human while it is blind to the cause of the greater collective that we are and hence, while it solves the problem for one and now, it also causes more problems to the whole of humanity that has to exist over a greater length of time.</p>\n<p>As we have now started understanding the bigger interconnectedness and continuity to be part of the problem statement in other sectors like climate change, we also need to use the same logic for healthcare as a whole, because curing one person now at the cost of millions later is surely not a wise move forward.</p>\n<p>While I am questioning allopathy for its short-sightedness, it doesn’t mean that Ayurveda has it going right for it and must be adopted as-is in replacement of allopathy for the greater good.</p>\n<p>It is clear that Ayurveda has also got its problems and shortfalls because of it being developed in the era where our understanding of the human body was extremely limited, making Ayurveda as a bit like finding what is wrong with the car by listening to its engine without opening the hood of the car.</p>\n<p>What we need is to develop allopathy using Ayurveda’s understanding of curing a human body using its own immune system by working on the overall metabolism.</p>\n<p>Allopathy needs to learn from Ayurveda to slow down and let the body heal.

        "contentMarkdown": "# Allopathy and Ayurveda\n\nAs I have been exploring the relationship between Ayurveda and allopathy, it is amazing to see the amount of opinions that are floating around about the issue.\n\nAs one common and practical theme that I see emerging is the usefulness of adding modern understanding of human body and illnesses that allopathy has to Ayurveda to develop it further, I need to make a deeper point that really needs cognition by humanity at large.\n\nTo start with, the core difference between most things Indian and western is the antiquity.\n\nAllopathy and Ayurveda are incomparable in terms of the duration for which they have served humanity.\n\nAllopathy as we know it now, is a product of technological advancements in our ability to “see” the inner workings of the body and hence most of its curative practices are barely 200 years old. Ayurveda, on the other hand, has been around for almost 1000/2000 years, if not more.\n\nIf we really want to understand what it means, there is one very simple question we have to ask for allopathy.\n\n## Will allopathy as we know it works for the next 2000 years?\n\nAn honest doctor who is watching antibiotic resistance rising or lifestyle problems emerging from those who receive quick cures from modern medicines would have to accept that it is extremely unlikely for most current allopathy medicines to work for even next fifty years.\n\nAnd if we speak to an evolutionary biologist, it gets worse as we get an Armageddon of pathogens becoming immune meeting humanity weakened by escaping natural selection due to allopathy. \n\nSo, it is clear that allopathy, at this point is a bit like a quick fix of curing a human body but a scary harbinger of a massive crisis for humanity at large.\n\nIf we look at Ayurveda, it may not be able to cure a plague or malaria that allopathy can, but it surely has its own slow way of bringing an imbalanced body back to balance and hence it is not helping pathogens to evolve and mitigating lifestyle diseases by offering a way of life through its slow and holistic cure that has more than just medicine popping as a cure.\n\nIf we really start looking at “curing” as a bigger problem in the context of humanity, it is clear that allopathy is great in curing an individual human while it is blind to the cause of the greater collective that we are and hence, while it solves the problem for one and now, it also causes more problems to the whole of humanity that has to exist over a greater length of time.\n\nAs we have now started understanding the bigger interconnectedness and continuity to be part of the problem statement in other sectors like climate change, we also need to use the same logic for healthcare as a whole, because curing one person now at the cost of millions later is surely not a wise move forward.\n\nWhile I am questioning allopathy for its short-sightedness, it doesn’t mean that Ayurveda has it going right for it and must be adopted as-is in replacement of allopathy for the greater good.\n\nIt is clear that Ayurveda has also got its problems and shortfalls because of it being developed in the era where our understanding of the human body was extremely limited, making Ayurveda as a bit like finding what is wrong with the car by listening to its engine without opening the hood of the car.\n\nWhat we need is to develop allopathy using Ayurveda’s understanding of curing a human body using its own immune system by working on the overall metabolism.\n\nAllopathy needs to learn from Ayurveda to slow down and let the body heal. We all should realise that there is no quick cure to any illness and hence our hurry of not missing the next movie or next opportunity to make money resulting in popping a few antibiotics has to be set aside for the sake of entire humanity.\n\nOn the other hand, Ayurveda can also continue developing its own way of diagnosis and cure using its own tools and medicines. Let us grasp that unlike allopathy’s clinical trials of a couple of years, Ayurveda can be looked at as clinical trials conducted over thousands of years and hence it can be a treasure trove for pharmacognosy.\n\nWe need to help allopathy and Ayurveda develop to reach a point of natural convergence instead of the forced one that AYUSH is attempting.\n\nIf Ayurveda will meet allopathy at this point, the humans looking for quick cures will force Ayurveda to become another allopathy and humanity may lose something that it is in dire need today.## ",

For each of 15 food categories, the targeted reduction in average sugar content was 20% by the end of 2026, except for sugar-sweetened beverages, which were targeted for reduction by 40%.

Different formulations of vitamin C can alter its strength and effects in the skin. Consider purchasing vitamin C products from your dermatologist’s office or a verified online retailer, with a clinical formulation that contains an active form of vitamin C (for instance, L-ascorbic acid), has a strength of 10% to 20%, and a pH lower than 3.5, as this combination has been studied in clinical trials. This information can be obtained from the manufacturer’s website under the ingredients section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-who-shouldnt-use-vitamin-c-products\">Who shouldn't use Vitamin C products?</h2>\n<p>Vitamin C has only been studied in adults and is not recommended for children. Always read the ingredient list before purchasing a vitamin C product. If you have sensitivity or a known allergy to any of the ingredients, consider a patch test or consult your doctor before use. If you have acne-prone or oily skin, consider using a formulation that also fights oils, or contains ingredients like salicylic acid that fight breakouts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-how-to-use-topical-vitamin-c\">How to use topical Vitamin C</h2>\n<p>During your morning skincare routine</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>use a gentle cleanser</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>apply a few drops of a vitamin C serum to the face and neck</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>apply moisturizer and sunscreen.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may experience a mild tingling sensation with the use of vitamin C.

Consider purchasing vitamin C products from your dermatologist’s office or a verified online retailer, with a clinical formulation that contains an active form of vitamin C (for instance, L-ascorbic acid), has a strength of 10% to 20%, and a pH lower than 3.5, as this combination has been studied in clinical trials. This information can be obtained from the manufacturer’s website under the ingredients section.\n\n## Who shouldn't use Vitamin C products?\n\nVitamin C has only been studied in adults and is not recommended for children. Always read the ingredient list before purchasing a vitamin C product. If you have sensitivity or a known allergy to any of the ingredients, consider a patch test or consult your doctor before use. If you have acne-prone or oily skin, consider using a formulation that also fights oils, or contains ingredients like salicylic acid that fight breakouts.\n\n## How to use topical Vitamin C\n\nDuring your morning skincare routine\n\n\n- use a gentle cleanser\n\n- apply a few drops of a vitamin C serum to the face and neck\n\n- apply moisturizer and sunscreen.\n\nYou may experience a mild tingling sensation with the use of vitamin C. You may choose to begin applying it every other day, and if tolerated you may apply it daily. It may take up to three months of consistent use to see a noticeable improvement. If you experience substantial discomfort or irritation, please stop using vitamin C and consult with your physician.\n\nVitamin C does not replace the use of sunscreen or wearing sun-protective clothing. Be sure to use broad-spectrum, tinted sunscreen daily, and limit sun exposure during peak hours.",
